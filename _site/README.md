Jekyll repo for my website.

I have done some changes to the [flexible-jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) theme, adding support for a list of publications.
I also added a navigation bar and did some other minor aesthetic modifications.
Feel free to fork the repo if you like the new theme, obviously it is badly commented :)
