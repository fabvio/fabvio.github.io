<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MBZUAI, working with [Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the [Torr Vision 
Group](https://torrvision.com/) at the University of Oxford, working with [Phil Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/). I am also a member of [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/).

I did my PhD at Inria [Astra-vision team](https://astra-vision.github.io/), in Paris (France), where I was supervised by [Raoul de 
Charette](https://team.inria.fr/rits/membres/raoul-de-charette/). 

I am currently interested in large-scale video diffusion models. In particular, I care about video generation for robotics and embodied AI applications, extending to world modeling and physics-aware 
learning. I am also interested in AI safety and multi-agent LLM systems.
