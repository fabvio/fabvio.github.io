<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at the University of Oxford, working with [Phil Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/). 

Previously, I was a co-tutelle PhD at Vislab/Ambarella, located in Parma (Italy) and Inria [Astra-vision team](https://astra-vision.github.io/), in Paris (France), where I was supervised by [Raoul de Charette](https://team.inria.fr/rits/membres/raoul-de-charette/). 

I am currently working on large scale diffusion models for image generation, and continual learning. During my PhD, my research focused on generative adversarial network models, in particular for modeling adverse weather and low-light scenarios.
